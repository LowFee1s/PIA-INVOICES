## This project is a Dashboard App that is a single page application (SPA) with client-side navigation and three main pages:
- Dashboard - A summary of all invoices.
- Invoices - A list of all invoices and the possibility of searching, creating, editing or deleting any invoice. It also has pagination at the bottom of the page.
- Customers - A list of all customers with a search bar for searching for specific customers. There's no pagination here in this version, so all customers are displayed at the same time.
- Dark Theme - Based on Tailwind.css and that only works based on the browser theme.

## Hereâ€™s everything I did in the version 2.0:
- Multiuser system
- OAuth Authentication
- Pagination for the customers, as they're going to be flexible at this version
- Dark Theme feature based on the user's browser theme
